            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
              Senior Spark Adventures was created from a simple belief: seniors deserve more than just care, they deserve connection, joy, and dignity in everyday life. We recognized how errands, outings, and modern technology can sometimes feel overwhelming, and how companionship can bring comfort back into those moments. From this understanding, our service was born, blending heartfelt presence, meaningful activities, and gentle guidance to make each day brighter and more fulfilling.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              To bring companionship, support, and confidence to seniors through meaningful experiences - whether at home, out in the community, or exploring the tools of modern life. We aim to spark joy, foster independence, and create moments that uplift both the spirit and the heart.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>
              We envision a community where no senior feels isolated, where staying active and connected is a natural part of daily life, and where technology is not a barrier but a bridge to family, friends, and the wider world.
            </p>
